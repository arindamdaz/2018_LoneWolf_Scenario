This scenario was created by Thomas Moore, a student at George Mason University, as his final project for CRFS 780: Cloud Forensics, taught in Spring 2018 by Simson Garfinkel. The purpose of the scenario is to give students the chance to work with a dataset that contains cloud artifacts left on clients, and to provide a scenario with a realistic size.
